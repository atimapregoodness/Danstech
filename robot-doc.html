            <h2 class="fs-6 fs-md-5"> 
                The word "robot" conjures up a variety of images, from R2D2 and C3PO of Star Wars fame; to human-like machines that exist to serve their creators (perhaps in the form of the cooking and cleaning Rosie in the popular cartoon series the Jetsons); to the Rover Sojourner, which explored the Martian landscape as part of the Mars Pathfinder mission.  Some people may alternatively perceive robots as dangerous technological ventures that will someday lead to the demise of the human race, either by outsmarting or outmuscling us and taking over the world, or by turning us into completely technology-dependent beings who passively sit by and program robots to do all of our work.  In fact, the first use of the word "robot" occurred in a play about mechanical men that are built to work on factory assembly lines and that rebel against their human masters.  These machines in R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), written by Czech playwright Karl Capek in 1921, got their name from the Czech word for slave.
                <p>The word "robotics" was also coined by a writer.  Russian-born American science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov first used the word in 1942 in his short story "Runabout."  Asimov had a much brighter and more optimistic opinion of the robot's role in human society than did Capek.  He generally characterized the robots in his short stories as helpful servants of man and viewed robots as "a better, cleaner race."  Asimov also proposed three "Laws of Robotics" that his robots, as well as sci-fi robotic characters of many other stories, followed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Law One:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Law Two:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Law Three:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h1 class="text-danger pt-5">What Exactly is Robot?</h1>
            <h2 class="fs-6 fs-md-5">
                A Robot i any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner. By extension, robotics is the engineering discipline dealing with the design, construction, and operation of robots.
                <p>The concept of artificial humans predates recorded history (see automaton), but the modern term robot derives from the Czech word robota (“forced labour” or “serf”), used in Karel Čapek’s play R.U.R. (1920). The play’s robots were manufactured humans, heartlessly exploited by factory owners until they revolted and ultimately destroyed humanity. Whether they were biological, like the monster in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), or mechanical was not specified, but the mechanical alternative inspired generations of inventors to build electrical humanoids.</p>
                <p>The word robotics first appeared in Isaac Asimov’s science-fiction story Runaround (1942). Along with Asimov’s later robot stories, it set a new standard of plausibility about the likely difficulty of developing intelligent robots and the technical and social problems that might result. Runaround also contained Asimov’s famous</p>

            <h1 class="text-danger pt-5">Early Conceptions of Robots</h1>
            <h2 class="fs-6 fs-md-5">
                One of the first instances of a mechanical device built to regularly carry out a particular physical task occurred around 3000 B.C.:  Egyptian water clocks used human figurines to strike the hour bells.  In 400 B.C., Archytus of Taremtum, inventor of the pulley and the screw, also invented a wooden pigeon that could fly.  Hydraulically-operated statues that could speak, gesture, and prophecy were commonly constructed in Hellenic Egypt during the second century B.C.
                In the first century A.D., Petronius Arbiter made a doll that could move like a human being.  Giovanni Torriani created a wooden robot that could fetch the Emperor's daily bread from the store in 1557.  Robotic inventions reached a relative peak (before the 20th century) in the 1700s; countless ingenius, yet impractical, automata (i.e. robots) were created during this time period.  The 19th century was also filled with new robotic creations, such as a talking doll by Edison and a steam-powered robot by Canadians.  Although these inventions throughout history may have planted the first seeds of inspiration for the modern robot, the scientific progress made in the 20th century in the field of robotics surpass previous advancements a thousandfold.

            <h1 class="text-danger pt-5">The first modern robots</h1>
            <h2 class="fs-6 fs-md-5">
                The earliest robots as we know them were created in the early 1950s by George C. Devol, an inventor from Louisville, Kentucky.  He invented and patented a reprogrammable manipulator called "Unimate," from "Universal Automation."  For the next decade, he attempted to sell his product in the industry, but did not succeed.  In the late 1960s, businessman/engineer Joseph Engleberger acquired Devol's robot patent and was able to modify it into an industrial robot and form a company called Unimation to produce and market the robots.  For his efforts and successes, Engleberger is known in the industry as "the Father of Robotics."
                Academia also made much progress in the creation new robots.  In 1958 at the Stanford Research Institute, Charles Rosen led a research team in developing a robot called "Shakey."  Shakey was far more advanced than the original Unimate, which was designed for specialized, industrial applications.  Shakey could wheel around the room, observe the scene with his television "eyes," move across unfamiliar surroundings, and to a certain degree, respond to his environment.  He was given his name because of his wobbly and clattering movements.

            <h1 class="text-danger pt-5">Industrial Robots</h1>
            <h2 class="fs-6 fs-md-5">
                Though not humanoid in form, machines with flexible behaviour and a few humanlike physical attributes have been developed for industry. The first stationary industrial robot was the programmable Unimate, an electronically controlled hydraulic heavy-lifting arm that could repeat arbitrary sequences of motions. It was invented in 1954 by the American engineer George Devol and was developed by Unimation Inc., a company founded in 1956 by American engineer Joseph Engelberger. In 1959 a prototype of the Unimate was introduced in a General Motors Corporation die-casting factory in Trenton, New Jersey. In 1961 Condec Corp. (after purchasing Unimation the preceding year) delivered the world’s first production-line robot to the GM factory; it had the unsavoury task (for humans) of removing and stacking hot metal parts from a die-casting machine. Unimate arms continue to be developed and sold by licensees around the world, with the automobile industry remaining the largest buyer.
            </h2>
            <h1 class="text-danger pt-5">The Future</h1>
            <h2 class="fs-6 fs-md-5"> 
                Numerous companies are working on consumer robots that can navigate their surroundings, recognize common objects, and perform simple chores without expert custom installation. Perhaps about the year 2020 the process will have produced the first broadly competent “universal robots” with lizardlike minds that can be programmed for almost any routine chore. With anticipated increases in computing power, by 2030 second-generation robots with trainable mouselike minds may become possible. Besides application programs, these robots may host a suite of software “conditioning modules” that generate positive- and negative-reinforcement signals in predefined circumstances. 
                <p>By 2040 computing power should make third-generation robots with monkeylike minds possible. Such robots would learn from mental rehearsals in simulations that would model physical, cultural, and psychological factors. Physical properties would include shape, weight, strength, texture, and appearance of things and knowledge of how to handle them. Cultural aspects would include a thing’s name, value, proper location, and purpose. Psychological factors, applied to humans and other robots, would include goals, beliefs, feelings, and preferences. The simulation would track external events and would tune its models to keep them faithful to reality. This should let a robot learn by imitation and afford it a kind of consciousness. By the middle of the 21st century, fourth-generation robots may exist with humanlike mental power able to abstract and generalize. Researchers hope that such machines will result from melding powerful reasoning programs to third-generation machines. Properly educated, fourth-generation robots are likely to become intellectually formidable.</p>
